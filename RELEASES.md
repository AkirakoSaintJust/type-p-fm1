The firmware is the device image. Flash it with `umetate flash`.
The plugin archives are optional and use the same engine as the firmware
and the web app.

## Sources

- `src/` is the project: the patch, the panel, the app glue, and the plugin
  identity.
- `framework/` is the complete umetate source, including the generator, the
  plugin, and the tests.
- `vendor/deps/` carries the fetched plugin dependency source.
- `LICENSING.md`, `DEPENDENCIES.md`, and `third-party-licenses/` carry the
  notices and the exact upstream pins.

## Licence

The firmware and the umetate source are GPL-3.0-only.
The plugin archives link JUCE 8, which is AGPL-3.0-only or commercial,
so the plugin archives are conveyed under the AGPL-3.0-only terms for
the JUCE part.
See `LICENSING.md`.

`SHA256SUMS` lists every download. Verify with
`sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`.
